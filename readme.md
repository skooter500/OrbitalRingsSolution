Game Engines 2 Lab Test 1 2017

The video below shows a simulation of electrons orbiting the nucleus of an atom. Electrons are coloured light blue in the video, while the nucleus is coloured red. Electrons orbit in orbital rings. Orbital rings are  numbered from 1..n, with the lowest numbers indicating rings which are closest to the nucleus. Each orbital ring can hold a fixed number of electrons. The number of electrons that each orbital ring can hold is given by the formula:

Though this is not important for the purpose of the lab test :-) In the simulation, each electron is travelling more or less around in its orbit, though the electron will wobble and not follow the orbit exactly. 

You are required to make a simple framework that can create simulations of different atoms, given its orbital ring signature. For example, the signature for the hydrogen atom is 2, mea
